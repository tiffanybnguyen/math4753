```

## Q 2

a. 50% 
```{r}
# In a population of 1,000 athletes, suppose 100 are illegally using testosterone. Of the users, suppose 50 would test positive for testosterone. Of the nonusers, suppose 9 would test positive
# P(Positive | User)
50/100
```

(1000 - 100 - 9)/(1000 - 100)
```

c. 84.75%
``` {r}
# If an athlete tests positive for testosterone, use Bayesâ€™ Rule to find the probability that the athlete is really doping.
# P(user | positive)
((50/100) * (100/1000)) / ((50/100) * (100/1000) + (9/900) * (900/1000))
```

## Q 3

3.1 - Informal Proof of the Multiplicative Rule

Step-by-Step (how I prove it in my mind)

1. Choose one element from the first set. You have $n_1$ choices
2. Choose one element from the second set. For each of the previous choice, you have $n_2$ choices, giving a total of  $n_1 n_2$ choices
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you reach the $k^{th}$ set, giving you a total combination choice of $n_1 n_2 n_3 ..... n_k$ choices. This is the number of different samples that can be formed.

## Q 4

3.2 - Informal Proof of the Permutations Rule

There are $N$ ways for the first position, $N - 1$ ways for the second position, $N - 2$ ways for the third position, and so on. The total number of ways to arrange the $n$ objects is $N(N - 1)(N - 2) ... (N - n + 1)$, which is the same as $$\frac{N!}{(N - n)!}$$

## Q 5

3.3 - Informal Proof of the Partitions Rule

Given $N$ elements and $k$ partitions with the first set containing $n_1$ elements, the second set containing $n_2$ elements, and so on, we count the number of ways to arrange $N$ elements in without partitions ($N!$) and divide by the number of ways to arrange the elements within the partitions ($n_1!n_2!...n_k!$). This gives us the formula $$\frac{N!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}$$

## Q 6

3.4 - Informal Proof of the Combinations Rule

Selecting $n$ elements from a set of $N$ elements is the same process as partitioning the $N$ elements into two sets: the $n$ elements you want to select and remaining ($N - n$) not selected. Using the partitions rule, we get the formula $$\frac{N!}{n!(N - n)!}$$
